# 1. React Folder Structure

"Code != Clothing, or How to neatly structure your code"


</SplitRight>

## First stop: grouping files by “type”

```
src
├── components
│  └── ...
│
├── actions (action creators)
│  ├── auth.js
│  └── product.js
│
├── types (action types)
│  ├── auth.js
│  └── product.js
│
└── reducers
    ├── auth.js
    └── product.js
```

You know where your socks are but how about your whole outfit?

# A different (better?) approach:
## The Uniform == Modularity

</SplitRight>

## Grouping files by feature

```
src
 ├── components <-- for basic, shared UI
 │  ├── Button.js
 │  ├── Select.js
 │  └── ...
 │
 ├── auth
 │  ├── components <-- components specific to the feature (likely won't be reused)
 │  │  └── Login.js
 │  │  └── PasswordReset.js
 │  ├── actions.js
 │  ├── reducers.js
 │  ├── types.js
 │  └── selectors.js
 │
 └── product
    ├── components
    ├── actions.js
    ├── types.js
    └── ...
```

# Bottom line

* What do we want as a team?

* Status quo vs "group by feature"

* Thoughts?

# 2. React-Styleguidist

</SplitRight>

---

## Start documenting your components

```jsx
/**
 * Description of the component if needed
 */
const Button = props => (...);

Button.propTypes = {
  /** No user action on button is allowed */
  disabled: PropTypes.bool,

  /** Primary theme color */
  primary: PropTypes.bool,

  /** Shadow effect */
  raised: PropTypes.bool
};
```

The component above will produce this clear output in style guide:

It's like **Swagger** but for UI code

</SplitRight>

---

## Documentation lives next to the code! :tada:

Styleguidist will look for **`README.md`** or **`ComponentName.md`** files by default.

```
components/
  Button/
    Button.js
    Button.md  <--- here
```

**Button.md**
```jsx
<Button primary>Click me!</Button>
```
